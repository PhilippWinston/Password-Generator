# <PPassword Generator JavaScript Fix>

## Description

I was tasked with filling out the JavaScript for this site to create a password generator that uses alerts and confirmation windows as selectors for password characters. The end goal was to generate a password and display it on the site.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When visiting the site, click the "Generate Password" button to begin the process. A series of alerts and prompts will guide you through selecting your password criteria, including character length, upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Note that if an invalid character amount or an invalid character is entered for the password length, the user will be prompted to input a valid character. Likewise, if the user selects no options for the password, they will be prompted to select at least one option. Check it out for yourself!

JS code #17,

I learned about `isNaN` (Not a Number) from MDN web docs as I looked for a better way to catch incorrect characters for the password length. You can read more about `isNaN` [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN).
